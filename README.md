# PDD
This is the Performance Driven Development manifesto.

The goal is to improve the ways of assuring performant, observable, and testable software before and during the development process.
The core values:

* Consider performance from day -1 of your project.
* Create software that self measures performance, is instrumented and monitored always and everywhere.
* Define performance measures and thresholds continuously and by the case.
* Evaluate performance through every environment in your pipeline, even after production release.
* Define, implement, measure, release, measure, repeat.
