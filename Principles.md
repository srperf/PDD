# PDD Principles and Goals

The principles that PDD follows should enable teams to create software that performs and can be validated constantly.

- Assure that the system performs even before creating it
- The software should communicate it's own performance
- Identify the changing performance and load risks per component and system-wide
- Define performance indicators and SLOs per component and update as needed
- Avoid handovers, who creates/updates it, instruments/automates it
- Create automatable software
- Create software paired with means to trigger it (automation)
- Don't move things through the pipeline without judging its performance
- Know that your software is performing before load-testing it
- Know your performance ALWAYS and EVERYWHERE (enable observability)
